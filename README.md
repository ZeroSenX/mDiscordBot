# mDiscordBot

The Music Discord Bot is a voice bot for the Discord platform, whose purpose is to play music acquired from YouTube in the server's voice chat. 

The main command is "!play" followed by the title of the song to be searched on YouTube.

The first time this command is executed, users must be in a voice channel, otherwise the bot will not proceed.

The command "!pause" pauses the music, and the command "!play" followed by nothing else will resume the music. 

The bot was developed in Java using IntelliJ IDE, using the JDA (Java Discord Api) library developed by Austin Keener, the lavaplayer library, and the JDACommands library updated to be compatible with the Discord api updates.
